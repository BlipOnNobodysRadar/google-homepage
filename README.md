From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project is to demonstrate an understanding of HTML, CSS, and a browser's webdev tool by creating a HTML/CSS copy of the google.com homepage.

During this project I learned much about how to apply the concepts in CSS and HTML that I've only read about, as well as learning some new things during the
process of inspecting and learning about how the real google homepage is organized with the Mozilla inspector. 

Some concepts I have become more familiar with:

Making a NavBar using lists in HTML and organizing it in CSS
Placing elements around the page where I want them in CSS
Making elements on the page interactive through :hover in CSS
Learned a lot about the rules of specificity while trying to change font colors/sizes and margins in different CSS classes/ID's.
